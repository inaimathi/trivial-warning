# trivial-warning

A Clojure library designed to allow warnings to be used in Clojure code.

It's sometimes useful to write error `raise`ing code that should fail in testing or production environments, but succeeds with a warning message while `REPL`ing for ease of interactive development.

The `warn` function defined in `trivial-warning` gives you that functionality.
